Science. Data. Software — and everything in between.

I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [DigiTraces Lab](https://digitraceslab.com/), focusing on computational social science. I build statistical and machine‑learning models to study social and behavioral phenomena.

Before my PhD, I earned a Master of Science from Aalto University in the Master’s Programme in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence (Macadamia).

Earlier, I worked as an iOS software developer at [ParkMan](https://parkman.io), a startup based in Finland.
